Purpose:
Program to test GPIO modules on LPC11Uxx

Running mode:
* Build, Debug

Description:
Based on the input interrupt received on the GPIO ports, the interrupt edge(rising/falling edge or level) 
is detected and the respective register(SIENR-Set Pin Interrupt Enable (Rising) register,SIENF-Set Pin Interrupt Enable Falling Edge) is set.

Output:
When an interrupt edge(single edge trigger, active low)occurs on the configured GPIO ports, 
GPIO interrupt occurs.
