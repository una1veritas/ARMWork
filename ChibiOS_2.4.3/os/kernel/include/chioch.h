 * @details This header defines abstract interfaces useful to access generic
 *          I/O resources in a standardized way.
 *
 * @addtogroup io_channels
 * @details This module defines an abstract interface for I/O channels by
 *          extending the @p BaseSequentialStream interface. Note that no code
 *          is present, I/O channels are just abstract interface like
 *          structures, you should look at the systems as to a set of abstract
 *          C++ classes (even if written in C). Specific device drivers can
 *          use/extend the interface and implement them.<br>
 *          This system has the advantage to make the access to channels
 *          independent from the implementation logic.
