Purpose:
Program to test Brown Out Detection (BOD) on LPC11Uxx

* Tested on Keil MCB1000 board

Hardware settings:
1.19 is for BOD reset,  
1.20 is for POR reset, 
1.21 is for BOD interrupt.
0.16 is for external interrupt to trigger power down.


Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.

Procedure:

  (1) POR LED should blink on after power cycle.
  (2) when voltage(VDD_MAIN) falls to the BOD interrupt level, BOD interrupt LED will 
  be ON, POR LED should be off. 
  (3) when voltage raises, BOD interrupt LED should be off, POR RESET LED will blink
  back on again. 
  (4) when voltage drops further to the BOD RESET, BOD RESET LED will blink. 
  (5) Once it happens, BOD interrupt is disabled. 

If DEEPSLEEP_BOD_WAKEUP flag is true. It will test, 
when MCU is in deep sleep mode, BOD RESET can be used as the wakeup source. 
	  
	  The procedure is: 
	  (1) Install jumper to put MCU into deep sleep mode.
	  (2) Decrease the VDD_MAIN voltage below BOD RESET.
	  (3) Increase the VDD MAIN voltage back to BOD RESET range.
	  (4) The system will be waken up, and BOD RESET LED
	  should blink.
