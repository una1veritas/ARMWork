@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the STM32F30x system to measure different
Low Power modes current consumption. The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC 
  - STANDBY mode with RTC

To run this example, user has to follow these steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f30x_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /* #define SLEEP_MODE */
       /* #define STOP_MODE */
       /* #define STANDBY_MODE */
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode as the JTAG IOs are disabled to
    reduce power consumption.

@note When using the small packages (48 and 64 pin packages), the GPIO pins which 
      are not present on these packages, must not be configured in analog mode.

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

 1. After reset, the program waits for USER button connected to the PA.00 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - In SLEEP_MODE, press again the KEY button to exit the low power mode.
     - In STOP_MODE and STANDBY_RTC_MODE, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after ~5s).
     - In STANDBY_MODE test, press again Tamper button to exit the low power mode.
     
 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (72MHz)
            - Flash 1 wait state
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line 0 (PA.00, connected to User push-button on STM32F3-Discovery)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - FLASH in deep power down mode
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI 

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wakeup using WakeUp Pin1 (PA.00, connected to USER push-button on STM32F3-Discovery)
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - IWDG OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035)
