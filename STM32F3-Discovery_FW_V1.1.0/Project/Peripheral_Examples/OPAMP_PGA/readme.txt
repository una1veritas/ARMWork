@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure OPAMP1 peripheral to amplify applied signal
on OPAMP1 non inverting input using the built-in PGA.
OPAMP1 is configured as following:
   - PGA mode enabled with gain set to 2
   - Non Inverting input is connected to PA5
   - Output is available on PA2

In this configuration the OPAMP1 amplifies the signal on PA5.
In this example the DAC peripheral is configured to generate a sine wave signal
on DAC_OUT2 (PA5) which will be amplified by the OPAMP1.

- Connect an oscilloscope to DAC_OUT2 (PA5) to display the sine wave signal
  generated by the DAC. 
- Connect an oscilloscope to OPAMP1 Out (PA2) to display the amplified (by 2)
  sine wave signal.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA5 pin to display waveform.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA2 pin to display waveform.
