@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regular period the WWDG counter and how to
simulate a software fault generating an MCU WWDG reset on expiry of a programmed 
time period.

The WWDG timeout is set to 58.2 ms and the refresh window is set to 80. 
The WWDG counter is refreshed each 43ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a WWDG reset.
LED4 is also toggled each 43 ms indicating that the program is running.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the rising edge of the signal.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the USER push-button, the corresponding interrupt is served.
In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception containing
an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the WWDG counter is 
not refreshed).
As a result, when the WWDG counter falls to 43, the WWDG reset occurs.
If the WWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED3 turns on.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the WWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no WWDG reset.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - None.
