@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to program the STM32F30x FLASH.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase page feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of pages to be used. Then all these pages will be erased one by one by
calling FLASH_ErasePage function. 

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed by 
using the FLASH_ProgramWord function. The written data is then checked and the
result of the programming operation is stored into the MemoryProgramStatus variable.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" file contains the system clock configuration for
      STM32F30x devices, and is customized for use with STM32F3-Discovery Kit. 
      The STM32F30x is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
      configuration below:
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSI
           - HSI (~8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system 
             clock source.  
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE          
           - HSE (8 MHz) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
             clock source.
           - The HSE crystal is not provided with the Discovery Kit, some 
             hardware modification are needed in manner to connect this crystal.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
        + PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS   
           - HSE bypassed with an external clock (fixed at 8 MHz, coming from 
             ST-Link circuit) used to clock the PLL, and the PLL is used as 
             system clock source.
           - Some  hardware modification are needed in manner to bypass the HSE 
             with clock coming from the ST-Link circuit.
             For more details, refer to section "4.10 OSC clock" in "STM32F3 discovery kit User manual (UM1570)"
      User can select one of the three configuration in system_stm32f30x.c file
      (default configuration is PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS).           

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3-Discovery (MB1035) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F3-Discovery Set-up
    - None.
