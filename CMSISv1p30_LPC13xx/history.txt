Updated with new LPC13xx.h (dated 2011-04-28). Some registers
have been renamed, though originals have been left in place
via the use of unions. It is recommended that code is ported
to use the new names...

... SSPCLKDIV => SSP0CLKDIV

In LPC_IOCON_TypeDef...
... JTAG_TCK_PIO0_10 => SWCLK_PIO0_10
... JTAG_TDI_PIO0_11 => R_PIO0_11
... JTAG_TMS_PIO1_0 => R_PIO1_0
... JTAG_TDO_PIO1_1 => R_PIO1_1
... JTAG_nTRST_PIO1_2 => R_PIO1_2
... ARM_SWDIO_PIO1_3 => SWDIO_PIO1_3
