@par Description

This directory contains binary file (*.hex) of the IO_Toggle example firmware V1.0.0
 customized to run on STM32F10x devices.
 
You can use any in-system programming tool to reprogram the demonstration using
this binary file, as described below:

  - Connect the STM32NUCLEO board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B'
    cable through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
  - Make sure that the embedded ST-LINK/V2 is configured for in-system programming
    (both CN2 jumpers ON)
  - Use the *.hex binary with your preferred in-system programming tool to reprogram
    the demonstration firmware (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).
