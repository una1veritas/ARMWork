@par Project Example Template Description 

This example is used as a template project that can be used as reference to build
any new firmware development for STM32F37x devices using the STM32F37x Standard 
Peripherals Library.


@par Directory contents 

This folder contains standard template projects for EWARM, TASKING, MDK-ARM and
TrueSTUDIO toolchains that compile the needed STM32F37x Standard Peripheral's 
drivers plus all the user-modifiable files that are necessary to create a new 
project. 

  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f37x_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f37x_it.c      Interrupt handlers 
  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/stm32f37x_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/main.c              Main program  
  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/main.h              Header for main.c module
  - Project/STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates/system_stm32f37x.c  STM32F37x system source file
  
@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
