@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM1 when using the
STM32373C-EVAL Transmit and Receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.

First, the EVAL_COM1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for 
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.The string that you have entered 
is stored in the RxBuffer array. The received buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as 
maximum (the reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN12 and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP6 is in position 2<->3 

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
