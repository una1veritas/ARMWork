@par Example Description 

This example shows how to retarget the C library printf function to the USART. 
This implementation output the printf message on the Hyperterminal using  USART2 
(EVAL_COM1).

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


@par Directory contents 

  - USART/USART_Printf/stm32f37x_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - USART/USART_Printf/stm32f37x_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - USART/USART_Printf/stm32f37x_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - USART/USART_Printf/main.c              Main program
  - USART/USART_Printf/system_stm32f37x.c  STM32F37x system source file
  
@note The "system_stm32f37x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F37x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4132 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (STM32F37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - USART2 (EVAL_COM1)  
       - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
         CN12(when USART2 (EVAL_COM1) is used) and PC serial port.
       - Make sure that JP6 is in position 2<->3
       
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
