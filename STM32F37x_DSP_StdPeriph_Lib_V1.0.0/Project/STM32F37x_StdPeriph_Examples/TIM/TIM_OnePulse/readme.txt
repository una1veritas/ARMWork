@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to generate a One pulse Mode 
after a Rising edge of an external signal is received in Timer Input pin.

TIM2CLK = SystemCoreClock, we want to get TIM2 counter clock at 36 MHz:
  - Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz.

The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM2->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
trigger the TIM2 input is 36000000/65535 = 366.2 Hz.

The TIM2 is configured as follows: 
The One Pulse mode is used, the external signal is connected to TIM2 CH2 pin (PA.01), 
the rising edge is used as active edge, the One Pulse signal is output 
on TIM2_CH1 (PA.00).

The TIM_Pulse defines the delay value, the delay value is fixed to:
delay =  CCR1/TIM2 counter clock = 16383 / 36000000 = 455.1 us. 
The (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse) defines the One Pulse value, the pulse value is fixed to:
One Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM2 counter clock 
                = (65535 - 16383) / 36000000 = 1.36 ms.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on stm32F37x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL (stm32f37x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to the TIM2_CH2 pin (PA.01)
    - Connect the TIM2_CH1 (PA.00) pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\stm32f37x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - stm32f37x devices are STM32F373x microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
   density ranges between 128 and 256 Kbytes.
