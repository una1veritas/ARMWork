History of updates to CMSISv2p10_LPC18xx_DriverLib
==================================================

Important - the code in this project is targeted at the 
LPC18xx "Rev A" parts. It is not suitable for use with LPC18xx 
"Rev -" parts.

Note that this project provides both the basic CMSIS
headers, as well as NXP's LPC18xx peripheral driver 
code which sit on top of CMSIS.

26 September 2011
-----------------
Initial version of CMSIS 2.1 library project for
NXP's LPC18xx using ARM  Cortex-M3 CMSIS files as
supplied in ARM's CMSIS 2.1 July 2011 release, 
together with device specific files from NXP's 
LPC18xx CMSIS-Compliant Standard Peripheral Firmware
Driver Library (RELEASE: LPC1800CMSIS_20110627).

[Note some includes in driver library have had their
 case corrected so as to build on Linux : 
 lpc18xx.h -> LPC18xx.h ]
