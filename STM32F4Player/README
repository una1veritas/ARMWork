** STM32F4 Discovery GLCD UI WavePlayer Demo                               **
*****************************************************************************

The demo shows how to use a 2.4" LCD with the STM32F4-Discovery board. Also
included is a small GUI Library I implemented using the touch panel.

Demo Applications called by menus include:
 - 3 RGB Test Patterns
 - A simple 'doodle application' - that lets you draw on the screen
 - Wave Player
 
The end result of my exercise will be to design a full-fledged mp3 audio player
with all bells and whistles!

NOTES:

The LCD I use is this one:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/2-4-TFT-LCD-Module-Display-Touch-Panel-PCB-adapter-/190477028273?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2c5950cbb1

It uses a 'new' S6D1121 controller, unlike the earlier ILI9325 variant.

You will have to close jumper J3 (IM0) on the back of module PCB to enable 16-bit mode.

The LCD is bitbanged and connected to the following pins:

CS			PD7
RST			PD10
RS			PD11
WR			PD8
RD			PD9

DB[0:3]		PD[0:3]
DB[4:15]	PE[4:15]

This code runs on ChibiOS 2.4.1

The UI & Text Rendering code of my library is based on the UI framework provided on this 
website: http://reifel.org/PICUserInterface/ . I wrote it two years ago for
my AVR development platform.

It also uses Chan's xprintf library.

I wrote my own implementation for controlling the onboard CS43L22 DAC and sending data to it via DMA.

The source files are self-explanatory.

You will have to change the ChibiOS path in the makefile.
