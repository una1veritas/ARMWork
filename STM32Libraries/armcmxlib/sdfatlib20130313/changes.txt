Fix for 1.04 malloc

New Software SPI

07 Feb 2013

Patch for 1.52 version of malloc.

Updated SPI driver for Teensy 3.0

Added fast printField() functions.

19 Dec 2012

Fixed SoftSPI bug

01 Dec 2012

Added support for the Arduino Due.

The default for ALLOW_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS has been changed to
false.  If you get compile errors for these functions, either
change to the prefered replacement function indicated in the
error message or set ALLOW_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS nonzero.

A key change was to remove sd.init(spiRateID, chipSelect) in favor of
sd.begin(chipSelect, spiRateID).  The difference between these two is
the order of the arguments which has caused serious confusion at times.

A massive number of internal changes have been made.  There are over 2600
lines in the diff file of this version and the 20120719 version.

20 Oct 2012

Changes to support ARM processors.  Tested with a Teensy 3.0.

Changes for higher performance with large reads and writes.

25 Aug 2012

Added uint32_t available();

Support for new industrial SD cards

Better support for MiniSerial and MiniSerial example

Changes to support newer versions of avr-gcc

Changed RawWrite example to use micros() for delay between blocks.

Changed SdFatSize example to use MiniSerial

19 Jul 2012

Require Arduino 1.0 or greater.  Change file type for all examples to *.ino.

Modify the SdFormatter example to format SDXC cards as FAT32.  This is not the 
SDXC standard which is exFAT.

30 May 2012

Added << operator for Arduino flash string macro F().

New RawWrite example for fast write of contiguous files.

New faster software SPI

Software SPI for Leonardo boards

Don't use __cxa_pure_virtual by default for Arduino 1.0 or greater.

26 Mar 2012

Removed definition for SS_PIN, MISO_PIN, MOSI_PIN, and SCK_PIN.  Used the
Arduino 1.0 symbols SS, MISO, MOSI, and SCK.

Added Arduino style SdFat::begin(chipSelect, spiSpeed);

Added options for SD crc checking.  Enabling crc checking increases reliability
at the cost of speed.  Edit SdFatConfig.h to select CRC options.

Override Print::getWriteError() and Print::clearWriteError() to use
SdBaseFile functions.

Many internal changes.

08 Jan 2012

Changes to allow use of the SerialPort library.

Error messages and output from programs are now sent to a stdOut Print
stream.

The default stdOut is a small non-interrupt driven class that outputs messages
to serial port zero.  This allows an alternate Serial library like SerialPort
to be used with SdFat.

You can redirect stdOut with SdFat::setStdOut(Print* stream) and
get the current stdOut stream with SdFat::stdOut().

If USE_SERIAL_FOR_STD_OUT in SdFatConfig.h is nonzero, the Arduino Serial
object will be used as the default for stdOut.


05 Dec 2011

Changes for Arduino 1.0


17 Sep 2011

Changes for Arduino 1.0 beta 4

Improved SPI handling

02 Sep 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warning:
Several changes are not backward compatible with the previous
version of SdFat.

The function cwd() was renamed vwd() to allow multiple SD cards.

The type SdBaseFile was added to the class hierarchy to avoid conflicts with
other Arduino libraries that are derived from the Print class.  Directory
files should be declared type SdBaseFile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added support for multiple SD cards.

Change the name of SdFat::cwd() to SdFat::vwd() since the volume
working directory is not the current working directory with
multiple SD cards.

Added the static function SdBaseFile::cwd() to return a pointer
to the current working directory.

Added the TwoCards.pde example to demonstrate use of multiple SD cards.

Added readCSV.pde example to demonstrate iostream extractors.

Added bool SdBaseFile::timestamp(SdBaseFile* file) to copy one
file's timestamps to another file.

Improved messages in the QuickStart.pde example.

Added maximum latency test to the bench.pde example.

Rearanged class hierarchy to fix conflicts with Flash.h and other Adruino
libraries.  Print is no longer a private parent of file stream classes.

Added high speed multiple block read functions to Sd2Card.

Changed include files in SdFatUtil.h

Removed option to write protect block zero of an SD card.

Changes for Arduino 1.0.

02 Jul 2011

This is a major update based on previous beta versions.
Read all changes since 10 Oct 2001

Simplified examples in extra/examplesV1

28 Jun 2011

This is a release candidate to replace sdfatlib20101010.

Initialize SPI bus before every access.

Improved write multiple block functions for fast data logging.

SdVolume::cacheClear() returns zero if it fails.

Documentation changes.

04 Jun 2011

Added SdFatTestSuite and fixed bugs found by test programs.

Added functions:

bool SdFat::truncate(const char* path, uint32_t length); 

int16_t SdFile::fgets(char* str, int16_t num, char* delim);

11 May 2011

Added QuickStart sketch and QuickStart.txt file for fast hardware test.

Added several new examples.

Version of ls() that can write to any Print object.

New functions including freeClusterCount(), openNext() rename().

14 Apr 2011

Total rewrite to add iostreams and SdFat class with current working directory.
Old API maintained for backward compatibility.


27 Nov 2010


Added experimental support for FAT12.  This can be enabled by setting
FAT12_SUPPORT nonzero in SdFatConfig.h.

Added an experimental sketch, SdFatFormatter.pde, to format SD cards as
FAT16 and SDHC cards as FAT32.  See SdFat/examples/SdFormatter.

The return type of SdVolume::cacheClear was changed to cache_t*.

Many internal changes to support FAT12 and formatting SD/SDHC cards.


10 Oct 2010

Added Mega 2560.

Fixed rmRfStar() bug.

Fixed Sanguino NULL definition.

18 Aug 2010

Optimized write() for append at end of file.  Up to 50% faster sequential write.

13 Aug 2010

Added the following function to allow the SD chip select pin to be set
at runtime.  Warning - if the hardware SS pin is not used as chip select, 
the hardware SS pin will be set to output mode by init(). An avr processor
will not function as an SPI master unless SS is set to output mode.

uint8_t Sd2Card::init(uint8_t sckRateID, uint8_t chipSelectPin);

Added more SPI clock rate choices.  The above init() function and 
uint8_t Sd2Card::init(uint8_t sckRateID) call the new function 
uint8_t Sd2Card::setSckRate(uint8_t sckRateID).

setSckRate() sets the SPI clock rate to F_CPU/pow(2, 1 + sckRateID).
On an 16 MHz cpu this ranges from 8 MHz for sckRateId = 0 to 125 kHz
for sckRateID = 6.  This function must be called after the init() call.

Modified most examples to call card.init(SPI_HALF_SPEED) to avoid SPI bus
errors with breadboards and jumpers.  This sets the SPI speed to F_CPU/4.
Defined SPI_FULL_SPEED so init(SPI_FULL_SPEED) sets the SPI speed to F_CPU/2.

Added the following  function to cancel date/time callback. This function
must now be used instead of dateTimeCallback(NULL).

static void SdFat::dateTimeCallbackCancel(void);


The following member functions have been added for users who wish to avoid
calls to functions with non-const references.

uint8_t SdFile::contiguousRange(uint32_t* bgnBlock, uint32_t* endBlock);
uint8_t SdFile::createContiguous(SdFile* dirFile,
  const char* fileName, uint32_t size);
static void SdFile::dateTimeCallback(
  void (*dateTime)(uint16_t* date, uint16_t* time));
uint8_t SdFile::dirEntry(dir_t* dir);
uint8_t SdFile::makeDir(SdFile* dir, const char* dirName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile* dirFile, uint16_t index, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::openRoot(SdVolume* vol);
int8_t SdFile::readDir(dir_t* dir);
static uint8_t remove(SdFile* dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card* dev);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card* dev, uint8_t part);

The following member functions have been marked as deprecated since they
are now wrappers for the new functions. dateTimeCallback is the only wrapper
with extra overhead.  The other wrappers are squeezed out by the complier.
These wrappers will be maintained in the future for backward compatibility.

uint8_t SdFile::contiguousRange(uint32_t& bgnBlock, uint32_t& endBlock);
uint8_t SdFile::createContiguous(SdFile& dirFile,
  const char* fileName, uint32_t size);
static void SdFile::dateTimeCallback(
  void (*dateTime)(uint16_t& date, uint16_t& time));
uint8_t SdFile::dirEntry(dir_t& dir);
uint8_t SdFile::makeDir(SdFile& dir, const char* dirName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdFile::open(SdFile& dirFile, uint16_t index, uint8_t oflag);
uint8_t SdFile::openRoot(SdVolume& vol);
int8_t SdFile::readDir(dir_t& dir);
static uint8_t remove(SdFile& dirFile, const char* fileName);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card& dev);
uint8_t SdVolume::init(Sd2Card& dev, uint8_t part);

The deprecated function can be disabled by editing SdFat.h and setting
#define ALLOW_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS 0

Fixed file modify time for file rewrite.

Major internal cleanup/reformat based on Google cpplint.py code style.

New Sd2Card::init() algorithm.

New SdFatInfo sketch for modified SdReadData() and other internal changes.

Modified examples to eliminate deprecated functions.

11 Jun 2010
Added definitions for Teensy to ArduinoPins.h (Paul Stoffregen)

Added troubleshooting.txt


23 Dec 2009

Added Software SPI capability.  See Sd2Card.h

Defining MEGA_SOFT_SPI allows an unmodified Adafruit GPS Shield to be used
on Mega Arduinos.  Software SPI works well with GPS Shield V1.1 
but many SD cards will fail with GPS Shield V1.0.

Added file ArduinoPins.h for pin definitions.

More error printout in examples.


25 Nov 2009

Added new functions for SdFile class:

dateTimeCallback(), dirEntry(), isRoot(), isSubDir, ls(), 
makeDir(), printDirName(), printFatDate(), printFatTime(), 
printTwoDigits(), rmDir(), and rmRStar().

Added new examples to test and illustrate use of new functions.

Removed sdCard() from SdFile class.

Fixed several bugs.




12 Nov 2009

Major rewrite of the version of SdFat that was included with
the WaveRP library.  

This is a preview that is being released to obtain comments
from several colleagues and future users.
