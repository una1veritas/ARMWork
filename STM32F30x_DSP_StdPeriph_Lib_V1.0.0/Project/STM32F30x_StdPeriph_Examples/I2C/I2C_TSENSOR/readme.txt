@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STTS751 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
STM32303C-EVAL board and used to get instantaneous external temperature (-55°C to +125°C).
 
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easily monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.
The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.

By default the STM32303C-EVAL demo are setting them to (see main.c file):
  
#define TEMPERATURE_THYS        0x14 /* 20°C */
#define TEMPERATURE_TOS         0x28 /* 40°C */

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board. 

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that JP5 and JP6 jumpers are fitted in position 2-3.
    - Make sure that JP1 jumper is fitted.
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following file the project source list
     - Utilities/STM32_EVAL/STM32303C_EVAL/stm32303c_eval_i2c_tsensor.c
 - Before building the project please make sure that "USE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CALLBACK" 
   define is removed from Preprocessor defines under C/C++ compiler settings. 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
