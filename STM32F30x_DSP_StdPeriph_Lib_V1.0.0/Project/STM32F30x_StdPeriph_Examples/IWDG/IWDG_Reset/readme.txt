@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regular period the IWDG reload counter and 
how to simulate a software fault generating an MCU IWDG reset on expiry of a 
programmed time period.

The IWDG timeout is set to 250 ms (the timeout may varies due to LSI frequency 
dispersion).

First, the TIM16 timer is configured to measure the LSI frequency as the 
LSI is internally connected to TIM16 CH1, in order to adjust the IWDG clock.

The LSI measurement using the TIM16 is described below:
 - Configure the TIM16 to remap internally the TIM16 Channel 1 Input Capture to 
   the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM16 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value. 
   
As a result, when the IWDG counter reaches 00h, the IWDG reset occurs.
If the IWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 turns on.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PE.08 and PE.09 pins
    - Use the KEY push button connected to PE.06 pin (EXTI Line6).
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
