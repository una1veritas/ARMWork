@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to configure the OPAMP1 in 
internal follower and how to use OPAMP1 output as ADC input.

OPAMP1 is configured in internal follower mode or unity gain;
the applied signal on OPAMP1 positive input (PA7) is reproduced on OPAMP1
output (PA2): the output follows the input.

The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC1 channel 3 (PA2) which is internally
connected to OPAMP1 output. Each time the channel 3 is converted an End Of Conversion
interrupt is generated.
The converted value of regular ADC1 channel 3 can be displayed on live watch.

To run the example:
   - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to OPAMP1 non-inverting input mapped on pin PA7.
   - Connect OPAMP1 output PA2 pin to an oscilloscope. It should be equal to PA7 level.
   - Add "ADCVal" to live watch to display the measured voltage. It should be equal to PA7 level.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM323303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

    - Make sure that JP11 is fitted.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
