@par  Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to WFI mode and wake-up from this mode 
using External interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 72MHz. When the user presses
on the Key push button, the MCU enters in WFI mode. If the user presses again on the
Key push button, LED3 is toggled with a frequency depending on the system clock, this
is used to indicate whether the MCU is in WFI or RUN mode. 

Pressing key push button (generates rising edge on EXTI Line6) will put the core
in the WFI mode, causing the LED3 to stop toggling.
To wake-up from WFI mode you have to press again on the button which generates an
interrupt which exits the system from WFI mode. Then LED3 restarts toggling.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
