@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the SYSCFG to enable and lock the PVD connection 
to TIM1 Break input.

In this example:
  - TIM1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on pin PA.08.
  - PVD threshold is configured to 2.9V.
   
While Vdd is higher than the PVD threshold (2.9V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.08.
While Vdd is lower than the PVD threshold (2.9V), PA.08 is in low level.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
   
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Use RV1 Potentiometer to adjust Vdd.
    - Make sure That jumper JP15 in position(VDD_ADJ).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display waveform.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
