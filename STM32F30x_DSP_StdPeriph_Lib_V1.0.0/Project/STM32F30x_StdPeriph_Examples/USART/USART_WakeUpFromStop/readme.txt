@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the WakeUp from STOP mode capability
of the USART via the hyperterminal.

First, the USART1 is configured to WakeUp from STOP with StartBitMethod(when any
data is received on RX line).
After configuration, the MCU enters STOP mode(WFI) and waits to be waken.
When a string is send to USART1 via the hyperterminal, the MCU WakeUp from stop,
restore the system clock configuration and configures the systick to toggle LED's.
The LED's toggling is used to indicate that the MCU is Waken Up from stop.

The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 and PC serial port.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
