@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM3 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different frequencies.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to 72 MHz

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 40960: 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 1757.7Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 878.8Hz.

The TIM3 CCR2 register is equal to 20480:
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 3515.6Hz
so the TIM3 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1757.7Hz.

The TIM3 CCR3 register is equal to 10240:
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 7031.25Hz
so the TIM3 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 3515.6Hz.

The TIM3 CCR4 register is equal to 5120:
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  14062.5Hz
so the TIM3 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 7031.25Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PA.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PA.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PB.00 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PB.07 (TIM3_CH4)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
