@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode. The sent frames are used to control Leds by pressing  
key push button.
	
The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - After reset LED1 is ON
  - By Pressing on KEY Button : LED2 turns ON and all other Leds are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus. 
  - Press on KEY Button again to send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other Leds 
    are OFF on the N eval boards.
    
@note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
@note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing KEY button)
      or receiver.
	
	The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
		- ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
		- RTR = Data
		- DLC = 1 byte
		- Data: Led number that should be turned ON

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PE.08, PE.09, PE.10
      and PE.11 pins
    - Use KEY Push Button connected to PE.06 
    - Connect a female/female CAN cable between at least 2 EVAL CAN connectors (CN3)
    - JP 4 is fitted in 1-2 position.
    - Check JP 3 is fitted.
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
