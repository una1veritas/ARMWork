@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer
continuously a data from a peripheral (ADC1) to another peripheral (TIM3) supporting
DMA transfer.The ADC channel7 is configured to be converted continuously. 
TIM3_CH3 is configured to generate a PWM signal on its output.
The dedicated DMA1 channel1 is configured to transfer in circular mode the last ADC 
channel7 converted value to the TIM3_CCR3 register. The DMA channel request is driven
by the TIM3 update event. The duty cycle of TIM3_CH3 output signal is then changed
each time the input voltage value on ADC channel7 pin is modified.
The duty cycle variation can be visualized on oscilloscope on the TIM3_CH3 pin
PB.00 while changing the analog input on ADC channel7 using the potentiometer.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
     - Use potentiometer RV2
     - Connect TIM3_CH3 pin PB.00 to an oscilloscope to visualize the duty cycle variation 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
