@par Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to simulate a precise chronometer with 5 record 
  times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (5 registers for time (second,
  minutes and hours) and 5 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using LCD and Push 
  Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the 
  LCD, it corresponds to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using Joystick LEFT, RIGHT and SEL buttons:
    - press Joystick LEFT  button to start counter.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to save trials in the backup registers (max 5 actions).
    - press and hold SEL button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - None.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
