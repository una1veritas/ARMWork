@par Example Description 

  This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
  Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
  The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
  8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer"
  display.

  After startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
  the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled for each 2 successive
  interrupts (after each 250ms).
  After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick SEL, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
    - press Joystick SEL button to Start the timer.
    - press again Joystick SEL button to stop the timer.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to Restart the timer.
    - press Joystick UP/DWON button to adjust the timer.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
  
  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - None.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
