@par Example Description 

This example shows how to make an analog watchdog using the STM32F30x COMPs 
peripherals in window mode:
  - The upper threshold is set to VREFINT = 1.22V
  - The lower threshold is set to VREFINT / 4 = 1.22V = 0.305V
  - The input voltage is configured to be connected to PA.01

If the input voltage is above the higher threshold, LD3 and LD1 are turned On.
If the input voltage is under the lower threshold, LD2 and LD4 are turned On.
If the input voltage is within the thresholds, the MCU remains in STOP mode

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PE.08, PE.09 ,PE.10
      and PE.11 pins
      @note This example run in stand alone mode.
    - Use a wire to connect Potentiometer RV2 (PC.01 pin) to COMP2 non inverting input (PA.01)


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
