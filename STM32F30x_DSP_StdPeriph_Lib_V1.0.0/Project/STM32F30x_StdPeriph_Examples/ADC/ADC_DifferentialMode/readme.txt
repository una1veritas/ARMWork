@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to convert continuously voltage applied
to a given analog input channel in differential mode.
Detailed steps of ADC configuration are provided starting from GPIO configuration
to the analog channel configuration without forgetting the ADC calibration procedure.  
In this example the ADC1 Channel7(PC1) and ADC1 Channel8(PC2) are both used to convert the diffential voltage between them.
ADC1 Channel7(PC1) is directly connected to the potentiometer(RV2) available on the STM32303C-EVAL evaluation board.
ADC1 Channel8(PC2) should be connected to an external power supply.
The converted differential voltage is displayed on the onboard LCD.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL RevB (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - RV2 Potentiometer connected to PC.01 pin.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP11 and JP12 is fitted.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP15 and JP17 are fitted in 3V3 position.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
