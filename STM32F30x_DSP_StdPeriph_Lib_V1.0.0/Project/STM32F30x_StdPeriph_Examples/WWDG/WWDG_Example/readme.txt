@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update at regular period the WWDG counter and how to
simulate a software fault generating an MCU WWDG reset on expiry of a programmed 
time period.

The WWDG timeout is set to 58.2 ms and the refresh window is set to 80. 
The WWDG counter is refreshed each 43ms in the main program infinite loop to 
prevent a WWDG reset.
LED2 is also toggled each 43 ms indicating that the program is running.

An EXTI Line is connected to a GPIO pin, and configured to generate an interrupt
on the rising edge of the signal.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the Key push-button, the corresponding interrupt is served.
In the ISR, a write to invalid address generates a Hardfault exception containing
an infinite loop and preventing to return to main program (the WWDG counter is 
not refreshed).
As a result, when the WWDG counter falls to 43, the WWDG reset occurs.
If the WWDG reset is generated, after the system resumes from reset, LED1 turns on.

If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the WWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no WWDG reset.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LD1 and LD2 leds connected respectively to PE.08 and PE.09 pins
    - Use the KEY push button connected to PE.06 pin (EXTI Line6).

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

@note
 - STM32F30x devices are STM32F303x microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
   density ranges between 128 and 256 Kbytes.
