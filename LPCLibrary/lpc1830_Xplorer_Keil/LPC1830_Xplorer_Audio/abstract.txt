@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2S for audio loopback through I2S port,
		the loopback sound via headphones.
	Process:
		To run on ex flash, be careful on setting Core Clock which will relate to Flash Timing
		I2S setup:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
			- stereo mode
			- master mode for TX
			- frequency = 48Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
      - enable transmit interrupt mode
      - Irq TXFIFO depth = 4
    Audio data will be copy in tx_buffer to send to TXFIFO register, after half of 
    buffer have been sent already, call I2S_Callback() function to re-fill data.

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files	
  	Main.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
		
						
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
		SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD						

	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and hear the loopback sound via headphones
		
		
I2S_audio -> set freq = 441000
