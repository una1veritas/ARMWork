@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use GPIO as source of an external interrupt.
	Process:
		- Configure pin as GPIO function
		- Configure GPIO pin interrupt
		- Interrupt is generated according to state of configured pin.
					
@Directory contents for External Interrupt:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Main.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
		
						
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
		SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						


	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Run example and when user key is press, the LED D3 will ON/OFF. 
		- Step 4: After see UGL(USB Good Link) led on board turn on, open Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)
				  see if "LPC18xx USB Vcom Port (COMx)" appears or not. 
		- Step 5: Open one HyperTerminal for COMx with below configuration:
					- 9600 bps
					- 8 data bits
					- none parity
					- 1 stop bit
					- None flow control
		- Step 6: Sure that you already connected COMx port on board with PC. Press user switch (SW2) to display message on HyperTerminal.


Note: The debug messages can be viewed on UART0 or USB1 (VCOM). This is configured by a Compile time switch in file 
      debug_frmwrk.h under drivers folder. Please note to use UART0 you need to use an external RS232 converter, 
	  the Xplorer board has the UART0 at TTL level.

@Setting up the VCOM port for debug messages:
	Purpose:
		This section describes how to use USB1 PORT on Xplorer board as .
	Process:	           
		If use USB Port 1, pls set Main Clock to 60Mhz in CGU_Init function       
			                    
		The PC will install a virtual COM port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
		After installation an additional port "LPC18xx USB VCom Port(COMx)"
		can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
		Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
		"x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
		dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
		Open Hyperterminal windows with "LPC18xx USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
      	
  		
		
@Driver Installation:
     "Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - select 'No, not this time'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Search for the best driver in these locations'
     - check  'include this location in the serach'
     - set to <project folder>
     - press 'Next'

     "Hardware Installation" appears
     "has not passed Windows Logo testing..."
     - press 'Continue Anyway'

     "Completing the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - press 'Finish'
