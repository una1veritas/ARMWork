@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to write a simple USB Mass Storage application on LPC18xx.
	Process:
		The MassStorage project is a Mass Storage simple demo run on LPC18xx
		
		If use USB Port 1, pls set Main Clock to 60Mhz in CGU_Init function
		
		It demonstrates an USB Memory based on USB Mass Storage Class.		
		The USB Memory is automatically recognized by the host PC
		running Windows which will load a generic Mass Storage driver.

@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	DiskImg.c: 		Disk Image (LPC18xx) data
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	memory.h/.c: 	USB Memory Storage
	msc.h: 			USB Mass Storage Class Definition
	mscuser.h/.c: 	Mass Storage Class Custom User
	usb.h: 			USB Definitions
	usbcfg.h: 		USB Configurate Definition
	usbcore.h/.c:	USB Core Module
	usbdesc.h/.c: 	USB Descriptors
	usbhw.h/.c: 	USB Hardware Layer
	usbreg.h: 		USB Hardware Layer Definitions for NXP Semiconductors LPC 
	usbuser.h/.c: 	USB Custom User Module
	memory.h/Main.c: 	USB Memory Storage Demo (main program)

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
	
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
					debugger tool before running
	
			
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Configure hardware as above instruction 
		- Step 3: Run Debug 
		- Step 4: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Open My Computer, you will see 'LPC18xx' disk.
		- Step 5: Open this disk, you will see 'Readme.txt' file (it has read-only attribute)
		- Step 6: Try to copy/delete another file into disk to test if Mass Storage is work well or not
		
		(Pls see "LPC18xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > USBDEV > USBMassStorage"
		for more details)
	
	Note: The USB Mass Storage application works in Internal SRAM mode, SPIFI mode is under development.	
@Tip:
	
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
