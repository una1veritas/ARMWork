This program is a BSD_Client example. It is used to send commands
to a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server connected on the same LAN.

In order to run this example, you need to set the network parameters
to match your local area network.

To test this example, you need also a server application to connect to.
Download and run a BSD_Server or LEDSwitch server on a different evaluation
board connected to the same LAN. When BSD_Client is running, LED diodes on
both evaluation boards should light in sync.

NOTE: IP address and MAC address of this example must be set different
      from IP and MAC addressess on LEDSwitch Server.

The BSD_Client example is available for one target:

STM32F107 Flash:
    Standalone application for MCBSTM32C Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.
