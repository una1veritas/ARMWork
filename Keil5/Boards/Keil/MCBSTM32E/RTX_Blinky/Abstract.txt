The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the ST 'STM32F103ZE'
microcontroller using Keil 'MCBSTM32E' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:


- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  STM32F103 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                    (used for production or target debugging)

  STM32F103 RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                    (may be used for target debugging)
