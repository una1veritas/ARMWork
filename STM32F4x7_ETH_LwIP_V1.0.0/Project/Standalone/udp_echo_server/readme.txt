@par Description

This directory contains a set of sources files that implement a UDP echo server 
demonstration for STM32F4x7 devices.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM324xG-EVAL board
     - DHCP server: PC utility TFTPD32 (http://tftpd32.jounin.net/) is used as a DHCP server
     - echotool: PC utility (Utilities\PC_Software\Server) is used as echo 
       client that sends data to the server and checking whether they came back.
  
  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect STM324xG-EVAL board to remote PC (through a crossover ethernet cable)
      or to your local network (through a straight ethernet cable)
    - STM324xG-EVAL jumpers setting

        +==========================================================================================+
    (*) User have to provide the 50 MHz clock by soldering a 50 MHz oscillator (ref SM7745HEV-50.0M or
        equivalent) on the U3 footprint located under CN3 and also removing jumper on JP5. This oscillator
        is not provided with the board. 
        For more details, please refer to STM3240G-EVAL evaluation board User manual (UM1461).
    @Note: the default setting is MII mode, to change it to RMII mode refer to main.h file.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  1. Load the demonstration code in the STM32F4x7 Flash memory (see below)

        window then click on Project->build project menu.
      - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
        Run->Debug (F11)

   - TrueSTUDO
      - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
      - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace directory.
      - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' and then click "Next". 
      - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory, select the project:
          - STM324xG_EVAL: to configure the project for STM32F4xx devices
